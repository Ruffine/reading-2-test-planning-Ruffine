# Reading: "The Inquiry Method for Test Planning"

This is a reading assignment, and as such has no single "right answer". All reading assignments must be submitted before the final week of class (that is, on or before Sunday April 22nd). 

## Instructions

 * Read the article https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/06/the-inquiry-method-for-test-planning.html. This was written by testers at Google, and comes from one of the better blogs on software testing out there (IMO).
 * Edit this document to include your answers to the questions in the following section.

## Questions
 
 1. Why does the article say that it *doesn't* supply a test plan template? In what circumstances might a test plan template be useful after all? **Answer**: Based on the article, test plan templates, I quote "are often too generic or too specific and could become quickly outdated." 
 A test plan content could differs from each company from the other so writing a test plan based on any template could not be understood by peers or superiors in the company.
 Which means a test plan template could be useful only when we are stuck on some points while writing a test plan, or we could refer ourselves to templates to have a better understanding on the content.
 1. As you read the article, list all the terms that you don't know the definitions of. If you don't list any terms, then explain your background and how you already have a background in testing terminology :) **Answer**: * Fuzz,
 * Dogfooding. 
 * The cost-benefit analysis principle (I know the definition of cost-benefit but I did not know that testing requires some billed resources)
 * Canary releases (aka % rollouts)
 Most of the others terms are known because they are fresh on my mind due to the fact that I am taking a "Software Testing" course this semester.
